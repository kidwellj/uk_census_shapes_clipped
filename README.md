# UK Census Polygons - Clipped!

Choropleth visualisations of data can often end up visually misleading in that they colour in polygons which contain vast tracts of uninhabited land. A more accurate visual communication can be achieved by clipping administrative polygons to data on the presence of buildings, that is, only using choropleth shading for areas which are inhabited.

It is time consuming to produce this data, so I have done so programatically and uploaded the resulting geopackage files to a public repository for easy re-use for reproducible research. 

The files in this repository are only the code used to produce those files. Separate licenses apply to that data etc.
